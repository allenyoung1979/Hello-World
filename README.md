# Hello-World
Just another repository


Hello my name is Allen, and I'm fairly new to this whole world, although I think I'm coming along fairly nicely. I haven't learned any languages yet; I am trying to figure out what to learn first and how to organise everything I need to learn to be a coder. I thought this place would be a good place to go looking for help.
